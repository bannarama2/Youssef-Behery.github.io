                        <p>A gamified productivity app designed for users with ADHD to boost task engagement
                            and focus. Users advance by
                            completing tasks to 'battle' a boss, leveling up and earning leaderboard ranks that foster
                            friendly competition and
                            sustained motivation. The app will feature a data-tracking system that offers weekly and
                            monthly
                            productivity insights,
                            similar to modern screentime analytics. Anticipated to improve engagement, focus duration,

                            sword. Because his sword has the ability to actually kill the evil goblins that are after
                            him and the villagers. He can
                            throw a concussion blast of some sort that will only stun the goblins momentarily. He can
                            jump on the goblins during
                            that time but he won’t be safe for long and will need to kill them at the end or else they
                            will wreak havoc on the game.

                <h1>Detection of Aimbotting in FPS games using ML</h1>

                        <p>This dissertation explores the detection of cheating in first-person shooter (FPS) games
                            through machine learning
                            techniques, focusing on aim-bot detection and mouse dynamics. Various models, including
                            MLPClassifier, Logistic
                            Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier, were evaluated to assess their effectiveness in
                            identifying cheating behavior. <br> <br>
                            The results demonstrate that the MLPClassifier performs well, achieving accuracy levels
                            around 80%, which aligns with
                            the study’s goals. While promising, the research highlights the need for further
                            improvements and ethical considerations
                            in data collection methods. Overall, the project aims to enhance anti-cheat systems within
                            FPS games using advanced
                            machine learning approaches.

                            It is my first game. All art and sounds and game
                            mechanics were made by yours truly. You play as a secret agent that was tasked
                            to terminate as many enemy operators as
                            they can during their survival. It is a top-down 2D shooter with
                            basic movement and aiming mechanics.
