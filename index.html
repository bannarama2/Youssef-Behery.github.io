                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>As a software engineer deeply committed to learning and growth, I'm driven by a relentless pursuit of
                    knowledge and
                    excellence. I specialize in crafting cutting-edge solutions that not only meet client needs but also
                    push the boundaries
                    of innovation. With a background in web and game development, I thrive on collaborating with
                    cross-functional
                    teams to deliver user-centric designs that exceed expectations. My passion for continuous
                    improvement extends beyond my
                    primary fields into fun projects, where I've explored machine learning and procedural animation
                    to tackle complex
                    challenges. From leading projects to participating in game jams, I embrace every opportunity as a
                    chance to expand my
                    skill set and make meaningful contributions.</p>
