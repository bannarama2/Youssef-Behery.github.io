                        <p>This game was made for the Simple Shooting Game hosted by nvthencncn on itch.io.
                            It is my first game. All art and sounds and game
                            mechanics were made by yours truly. You play as a secret agent that was tasked
                            to terminate as many enemy operators as
                            they can during their survival. It is a top-down 2D shooter with
                            basic movement and aiming mechanics.

                        <p>This dissertation explores the detection of cheating in first-person shooter (FPS) games
                            through machine learning
                            techniques, focusing on aim-bot detection and mouse dynamics. Various models, including
                            MLPClassifier, Logistic
                            Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier, were evaluated to assess their effectiveness in
                            identifying cheating behavior. <br>
                            The results demonstrate that the MLPClassifier performs well, achieving accuracy levels
                            around 80%, which aligns with
                            the studyâ€™s goals. While promising, the research highlights the need for further
                            improvements and ethical considerations
                            in data collection methods. Overall, the project aims to enhance anti-cheat systems within
                            FPS games using advanced
                            machine learning approaches.

                            coffee rises around him, Joe must leap from platform to platform, navigating a treacherous
                            landscape that grows
                            increasingly challenging. <br> Initially crafted for a game jam hosted by Kyojr on Itch.io,
                            The Floor is Coffee combines charming visuals and addictive
                            gameplay, inviting players to test their reflexes and compete for the top spot on the
                            leaderboard (coming soon). Will
                            you help Joe outrun his fate, or will he succumb to the sea of coffee? Jump in and find out!
